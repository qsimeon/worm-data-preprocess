# Installation Guide

**GUIDE AUTOGENERATED BY GPT4o**

This guide will walk you through setting up your environment to run the code using both Conda and pip. The setup uses `requirements_conda.txt` for Conda-managed dependencies and `requirements_pip.txt` for pip-managed dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Conda** installed. If not, download and install it from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
- Install a Python version compatible with the listed libraries (e.g., Python 3.8+).

---

## Step 1: Create a Conda Environment

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to create a new Conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n myenv python=3.8
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name.

3. Activate the environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

---

## Step 2: Install Conda Dependencies

Install the dependencies listed in `requirements_conda.txt` using the following command:

```bash
conda install --file requirements_conda.txt
```

---

## Step 3: Install pip Dependencies

1. Ensure pip is installed in your Conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda install pip
   ```

2. Install the pip-managed dependencies listed in `requirements_pip.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_pip.txt
   ```

## Notes

### PyTorch Geometric

- PyTorch Geometric may require additional steps for installation, depending on your system's CUDA version.
- Check the [PyTorch Geometric Installation Guide](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html) and use the appropriate commands for your configuration.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with conflicting dependencies, consider isolating pip-installed packages using `pip install --no-deps` or updating the package versions.
- To verify all dependencies are installed, you can run:
  ```bash
  conda list
  pip freeze
  ```

---

## Step 4: Run the Code

After installation, you're ready to run the code. Activate your environment if itâ€™s not already active:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

Run your Python script:

```bash
python your_script.py
```

---

## Optional: Export Environment for Sharing

To share your environment with others, export it as a YAML file:

```bash
conda env export > environment.yml
```

Others can replicate your environment using:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
