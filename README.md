**GUIDE AUTOGENERATED BY GPT4o**

This guide will walk you through setting up your environment to run the code using a Conda environment YAML file for managing dependencies.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have **Conda** installed. If not, download and install it from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
- Install a Python version compatible with the listed libraries (e.g., Python 3.8+).

## Step 1: Create a Conda Environment

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new Conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

3. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate worm-preprocess
   ```

## Step 2: Run the Code

After setting up the environment, you're ready to run the code. Ensure your environment is activated:
```bash
conda activate worm-preprocess
```
The size of the environment is ~900MB.

Run your Python script:
```bash
python preprocess.py
```
